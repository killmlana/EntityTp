#### Bring your mounts and pets when you teleport to your Friend's House. Entitytp is a simple plugin which allows simultaneous teleportation of pets and horses along with you. 

### Range of teleportation (number of blocks you have to be within your animal):
#### Wolves, Cats and other pets: 10 blocks
#### Horses, Llamas, Donkeys: You have to ride them while teleporting

# WARNING: ## This is not a teleportation plugin. You need an external teleportation plugin. You can use this with major plugins like Essentials, AdvancedTp, etc. or you can use it in vanilla minecraft teleportation commands.
